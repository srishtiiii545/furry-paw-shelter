                resolve disputes between Buyers and Sellers.

                a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller. Disputes
                arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not being completely
                satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <div> It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should
                attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a
                dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is put on hold immediately
                until the issue is resolved.
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <div> How is a 'dispute' created? - Whenever there is a disagreement, the
                Buyer can write to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8aebeee7e3e4cafee2effaeffee4eff9fea4e9e5e7"><span class="_cf_email_" data-cfemail="5b3a3f3632351b2f333e2b3e2f353e282f75383436">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, while the Seller

                Disputes can be raised at a particular transaction level.
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <div> What are the various types of 'disputes'? - Following are the indicative
                examples of potential disputes:<br><br>
